# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILLIAN_ECOMMERCE_DATA_ANALYSIS

In this project, our group conducted an end-to-end Business Intelligence analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce (Olist) dataset using Power BI. We collaboratively cleaned, transformed, and modeled multiple relational datasets—including orders, customers, products, payments, reviews, and geolocation data—using Power Query and data modeling techniques. As a team, we defined key business KPIs such as total revenue, total orders, average delivery time, customer retention, and product category performance. We built interactive dashboards with DAX measures, time-series analysis, and geographic visualizations to uncover sales trends, regional performance patterns, logistics efficiency, and customer purchasing behavior. Through teamwork and task distribution across data preparation, modeling, visualization, and insight generation, we transformed raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that support strategic decision-making and operational improvements.
